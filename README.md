# Sentiment-Analysis-with-LSTM-Neural-Network
The code utilizes TensorFlow and Keras libraries to preprocess textual data, tokenize it, and build an LSTM model for sentiment classification. This repository serves as a practical example for implementing deep learning techniques in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis.

# Sentiment Analysis using LSTM Neural Network

This repository contains a Python script for sentiment analysis using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Overview

The provided script utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze the sentiment of textual data. It employs an LSTM neural network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), which is well-suited for sequence modeling tasks like sentiment analysis.

## Requirements

To run the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DataDudeSaadKhan/Sentiment-Analysis-with-LSTM-Neural-Network.git
```

2. **Navigate to Repository Directory**: Change your current directory to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd sentiment-analysis-lstm
```

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script `sentiment_analysis.py`:

```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

4. **Input Data**: Provide your dataset in CSV format named `Train.csv` containing two columns: `text` (reviews) and `label` (sentiment).

5. **Interpret Results**: The script will output the accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix of the sentiment analysis model.

## Script Explanation

- **Data Preprocessing**: The script preprocesses the input textual data by tokenizing and padding sequences to ensure uniform length.
- **Model Building**: It constructs a sequential LSTM model using Keras, consisting of an embedding layer, LSTM layer, and dense output layer.
- **Model Training**: The model is trained on the provided dataset using early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- **Model Evaluation**: After training, the model is evaluated using test data, and performance metrics are printed for assessment.
